- Setup page will be designed and implemented in future iterations

## ⏸️ Deferred

## Background

User requirements:
1. Guide users to install corresponding components
2. Detect installation status
3. Step-by-step guidance for installation and Connect operations
4. Check current status

Usage scenarios:
- First-time onboarding
- Later check status via sidebar
- Not frequently opened

## Context Notes

- Hooks creation must be done via CLI commands
- Setup page needed to guide users through installation and connection
- Can be a full setup page or Walkthrough (decision deferred)
- Priority: Focus on core features first, refine this later
