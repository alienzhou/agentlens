# AgentLens Logo Design Discussion

## 🔵 Current Focus
- (none - discussion complete)

## ⚪ Pending
- (none)

## ✅ Confirmed
- **Abstract symbols** over figurative imagery
- **GitLens-inspired direction**: Commit graph style with Agent twist
- **Variant A: Hexagon Nodes** - Same vertical line + 3 nodes structure as GitLens, but hexagons instead of circles
- Keep overall shape identical to GitLens classic commit graph

## ❌ Rejected
- Magnifying glass metaphor (too generic)
- Eye/Lens metaphor (doesn't convey multi-agent)
- C3 Nodes Orbiting Code (pivoting to GitLens-inspired approach)
- Variant B: Mixed shapes (too complex)
- Variant C: Fork/branch (loses commit history feel)
- Variant D: Star nodes (too "magical", not technical enough)
