# D04: Todo Item Definition

> Status: Confirmed | Round: R2 | Date: 2026-01-26

## Core Definition

**Confirmed**: Todo items refer to **Task breakdown generated by Agent itself**

## Agent Representations

| Agent | Representation Form |
|-------|---------------------|
| Cursor | Task breakdown list, step planning |
| Claude | Step-by-step execution plan |
| Other Agents | Similar task decomposition output |

## Data Model Impact

- Todo data needs to be collected from Agent's task breakdown output
- Associate with SessionSource (source tracing)
- Establish bidirectional index with ReviewUnit

## Example

When an Agent receives a task like "Implement user login", it may break it down to:

```
1. Create login form component
2. Add form validation logic
3. Implement API call to auth endpoint
4. Handle success/error responses
5. Add session storage
```

These breakdown items are what we call "Todo items" in the context of this project.
