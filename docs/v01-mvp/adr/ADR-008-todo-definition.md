# ADR-008: Todo Item Definition

**Status**: ✅ Decided (2026-01-26)  
**Related**: [ADR Index](./index.md)

---

## Context

Need to clarify what "Todo items" mean in the context of Agent Blame system.

---

## Decision Content

**Confirmed**: Todo items refer to **task breakdown generated by Agent itself**

| Agent | Representation Form |
|-------|---------------------|
| Cursor | Task breakdown list, step planning |
| Claude | Step-by-step execution plan |
| Other Agents | Similar task decomposition output |

**Example**:
When an Agent receives a task like "Implement user login", it may break it down to:
```
1. Create login form component
2. Add form validation logic
3. Implement API call to auth endpoint
4. Handle success/error responses
5. Add session storage
```

These breakdown items are what we call "Todo items".

---

## Alternatives

1. **User-defined TODO**: TODO comments marked by users in code
2. **Review TODO**: Pending items generated during Review process
3. **Mixed Definition**: Include all of the above

---

## Decision Rationale

1. **Source Clarity**: Clearly associate with Agent execution context
2. **Traceability**: Can trace back to original conversation and session
3. **Scope Definition**: Avoid confusion with traditional TODO concepts

---

## Impact

**Positive Impact**:
- Clear data model definition
- Easy to trace Agent execution flow
- Provide context for Review

**Negative Impact**:
- Need to parse Agent's task breakdown output
- Different Agent output formats need adaptation
